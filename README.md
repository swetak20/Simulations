## Number of Collision
### Objects:
  1. Block 1; mass = 1 unit
  2. Block 2; mass = 100^(d-1)
  3. Wall; mass = inf

<!-- ![alt tag] -->

*Initial State* :  Block 1 remains at rest with no contact with the wall. Block 2 moves with velocity in the direction towards block 1. The first collision happens between the two blocks.
*State of affairs* : All the collisions are perfectly elastic. The subsequent collisions are goverened by the laws of linear momentum conservation, total energy conservation. 
*Aim* : To calculate the total number of collisions between the two blocks and block 1 and wall. The collisions stop when Block 2 attains velocity with magnitude greater than magnitude of velocity of block 1 and its direction is away from block 1.
